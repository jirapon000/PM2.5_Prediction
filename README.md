# PM2.5_Prediction
This project provides real-time monitoring and prediction of air quality using the Air Quality Index (AQI). The dashboard enables users to visualize pollutant concentrations such as PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, NO₂, CO, and O₃, and take preventive actions based on real-time data.

**Features**

-Real-Time Monitoring: Track current air quality levels, including various pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, NO₂, CO, and O₃).

-Prediction Models: Predict future air quality levels using machine learning models trained on historical data.

-Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly interface that displays pollutant information with color-coded metrics, making it easy to understand the air quality status.

-Protective Measures: Information on how to protect yourself from air pollution, including PM2.5, PM10, and other common pollutants.

-Air Quality Forecasting: View predictions for future pollutant levels and plan activities accordingly.
